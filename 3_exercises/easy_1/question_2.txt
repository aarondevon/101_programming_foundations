Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby.
And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:

1. what is != and where should you use it?
  != means not equals
2. put ! before something, like !user_name
  ! before something means the opposite of the objects boolean equivalent
3. put ! after something, like words.uniq!
  ! after a method is actually part of the method name. We do not know for sure what the method does.
4. put ? before something
  ? is the ternary operator
5. put ? after something
  ? put after a method is actually part of the method name. We do not know for sure what the method does.
6. put !! before something, like !!user_name
  !! before something turns the object into its boolean equivalent.
